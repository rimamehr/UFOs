# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project
For this project I created a webpage for UFO sightings that uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js. I was tasked with building a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. I also created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it reacted to user input, and then placed the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

I customized my webpage using Bootstrap, and equiped the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.The dataset is a sample set of UFO sightings in the U.S. (the first two weeks of January 2010 only).

My site allows users to filter the data on multiple values including Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. The user can enter one or any number of these filters to return the filtered table displayed on the page.

**_Additionally, I added a clear search button which resets the table to its unfiltered state._**

## Results

### In the screeshot below you can see how easily we can filter the data on a selected date.

### Here is a snapshot of how we can clear our previous selection using the clear filter button and then filtering the data by a new search parameter of state.

### In this screenshot you can see how the user can filter that data using multiple criterias. If someone wanted to narrow their search to a very specific event, they could easily do that by entering multiple filters.

## Summary
- This new design is great but if we could add a functionality for a user to be able to download their filtered search results for further analysis that would be great.
- I felt the need for a clear search button that i added to my webpage which was not part of the challenge.
- Additionally we could also make this webpage dynamic by adding web scraping functionality to get additional sighting data.
